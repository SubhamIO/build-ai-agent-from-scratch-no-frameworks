    "## Approach \n",
    "#### Planning: Using LLM for Research Question Generation \n",
    "-  The agent will use an LLM (for example: OpenAI's GPT or Gemini or Ollama for local LLM to assist in reasoning. The agent first asks the LLM to generate a list of research questions related to the given topic. \n",
    "- The LLM should suggest 5 to 6 well-structured questions that cover different aspects of the topic. \n",
    "- Example: If the topic is \"Climate Change,\" the LLM may generate questions like: \n",
    "  1. What are the main causes of climate change? \n",
    "  2. How has global temperature changed over the past century? \n",
    "  3. What policies are in place to combat climate change? \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Acting: Web Search for Gathering Information \n",
    "- The agent will take each research question and search the web to find relevant and recent information. \n",
    "- The agent should extract key points from search results and store them. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Report Generation \n",
    "- After collecting data for all questions, the agent will compile a structured report summarizing its findings. \n",
    "- The report should have a title, an introduction, sections for each research question, and a conclusion"

      "## Conclusion\n",
      "Based on the research findings, here are 4-5 key bullet points summarizing the conclusions:\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Climate Change is Primarily Driven by Human Activities**: The research confirms that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture, are the primary drivers of climate change, accounting for over 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Climate Change Impacts Global Food Security and Health**: Climate change poses significant risks to global food security, particularly in developing countries, and has severe health implications for vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and the poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Transitioning to Renewable Energy is Crucial**: The research highlights the need to transition to renewable energy sources to combat climate change, with benefits including reduced energy bills, job creation, and improved air quality. Investing in renewable energy is essential to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Urbanization and Climate Change Intersect**: The effects of urbanization and climate change are converging, with urban planning playing a critical role in reducing emissions and enhancing resilience. Cities must adopt sustainable and resilient infrastructure development to adapt to climate challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Geoengineering Technologies are Not a Viable Solution**: While geoengineering technologies may offer some benefits, they are fraught with risks, uncertainties, and dangers that threaten to delay real climate action and cause more harm than good. A more effective approach is to focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable land use practices.\n",

Exploring the trends in the Smart City industry, such as citizen empowerment and sustainability, can help urban planners understand how to improve resource efficiency and sustainability in urban areas. Leveraging innovative approaches to improve air quality in urban settings ensures that urban areas can adapt to climate challenges while promoting sustainability. Additionally, understanding the impact of air quality management in urban planning can further enhance city resilience. Urban planning drives climate change solutions through city design.\n",

       "## Conclusion\n",
       "Based on the research findings, here are 4-5 key bullet points summarizing the conclusions:\n",
       "\n",
       "• **Climate Change is Primarily Driven by Human Activities**: The research confirms that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture, are the primary drivers of climate change, accounting for over 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
       "\n",
       "• **Climate Change Impacts Global Food Security and Health**: Climate change poses significant risks to global food security, particularly in developing countries, and has severe health implications for vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and the poor.\n",
       "\n",
       "• **Transitioning to Renewable Energy is Crucial**: The research highlights the need to transition to renewable energy sources to combat climate change, with benefits including reduced energy bills, job creation, and improved air quality. Investing in renewable energy is essential to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\n",
       "\n",
       "• **Urbanization and Climate Change Intersect**: The effects of urbanization and climate change are converging, with urban planning playing a critical role in reducing emissions and enhancing resilience. Cities must adopt sustainable and resilient infrastructure development to adapt to climate challenges.\n",
       "\n",
       "• **Geoengineering Technologies are Not a Viable Solution**: While geoengineering technologies may offer some benefits, they are fraught with risks, uncertainties, and dangers that threaten to delay real climate action and cause more harm than good. A more effective approach is to focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable land use practices.\n"
